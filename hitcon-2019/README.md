# HITCON 2019



I solved: 

* Welcome series
* Emoji rev and pwn
* treak or treat

I half-solved:

* lazyhouse (@candymate)
* PoE I - Luna (@lemonwater)
* One Punch Man (@mathboy7)

half-things like that: they found main vulnerabilities and get pc control, but had been suffred from getting flag.

So I just did late part of exploit :/
